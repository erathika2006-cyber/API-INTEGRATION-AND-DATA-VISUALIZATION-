API Integration and Data Visualization using Python is an important concept in modern software development and data analysis. API stands for Application Programming Interface and it allows different applications to communicate with each other and share data securely. In this project the OpenWeatherMap public API is used to fetch real time weather data such as temperature and humidity for a selected city. Python is used as the programming language because it is simple flexible and widely used for data related tasks.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how external data can be collected using an API and converted into meaningful visual information. The requests library in Python is used to send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap server and receive data in JSON format. JSON is a lightweight data format that is easy to read and process. After receiving the response the required weather values are extracted from the data.

Once the data is fetched the next step is data visualization. Data visualization is the graphical representation of information using charts or graphs. In this project Matplotlib is used to create a simple bar chart that displays temperature and humidity values. Visualization helps users understand data quickly and easily when compared to raw numerical values. It is especially useful when dealing with real time or large datasets.
